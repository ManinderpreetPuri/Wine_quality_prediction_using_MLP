# Wine_quality_prediction_using_MLP
This project is to predict the quality of wine based on features like alcohol content and density, using a publically available dataset. The target variable of "quality" is a subjective measure of the wine's quality based on expert tasters. I am using pandas, numpy, torch and matplotlib in python.
